# MY JATE

## Description
This PWA project allows the user to create text, like a to-do list which can be deployed locally or online. This can be useful when the user is offline and still needs to remember things. When starting the application, it can be started from the root or Develop directory which triggers both the client and server side to run. The webpack has been installed to further user experience and style. The application is deployed using Render.
